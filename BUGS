BUG 001 21-june-2021 Closed
    OSC command /pig/q-children and pig/q-parents without arguments  causes
    a segmentation fault.

    1) expect() is not detecting missing argument.
    2) In queryChildren() msg.Arguments has a spurious empty strings.
    Fix: expect() test for spurious initial value in arguments.
