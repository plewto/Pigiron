# Example batch file creates the following process tree.
#
#  MIDIInput -> ChannelFilter -> Distributor -+-> Monitor -> MIDIOutput

# Commands have the general form:
#
#   command arg-1, arg-2, ..., arg-n
#
# The command 'q-commands' displays a list of available commands,
# while the help command displays help text for a specific command.
# 'help topics' displays a list of available topics.
#
#
# The 'new' command creates new operators.
#
#     syntax:  new operator-type, name
#
#
# An Operator's name must be unique.  A name may be reused only for the
# same type of operator:
#
#     new ChannelFilter, foo
#     new ChannelFilter, foo
#
# The above lines are OK, however the 2nd line is ignored and the original
# 'foo' operator is remains in place.
#
#     new ChannelFilter, foo
#     new Distribute, foo
#
# These two lines will fail.  The original 'foo' operator will remain the
# same but a Distributor with the same name can not be created.

new ChannelFilter, filter  # creates a ChannelFilter named 'filter'.


# For the MIDIInput and MIDIOutput Operators the new command has a slightly
# different syntax.
#
#    new MIDIInput, name, device
#    new MIDIOutput, name, device
#
# Where device is the backing MIDI device and may either be an integer
# index or a sub-string of the device's name.
#
# The q-midi-inputs and q-midi-outputs commands displays a list of
# available MIDI devices.  On the system this is being written on
# q-midi-inputs returns:
#
#	[ 0] "Midi Through Port-0" 
#	[ 1] "E-MU Xmidi 2x2 MIDI 1" 
#	[ 2] "E-MU Xmidi 2x2 MIDI 2" 
#	[ 3] "Arturia MiniLab mkII MIDI 1"
#	[ 4] "FastTrack Pro MIDI 1" 
#
# The device at index 1 may be specified by either the number 1 or by a
# sub-string of it's name.  If the sub-string matches more then
# one device, the first matching device is used. 
#

new MIDIInput, in, 0               # device by index
new MIDIOutput, out, 0        


# Create remaining Operators
#

new MIDIPlayer, player
new Distributor, distributor
new Monitor, monitor

# The connect command makes non-branching connections between operators. At
# a minimum it takes two operator arguments but may make any number of
# additional connections:
#
#    connect a, b, c, ...         # a -> b -> c -> ...
#

connect in, filter, distributor, monitor, out

# Since the MIDI player is on a branch, a separate connect command is
# required.

connect player, monitor


# The 'op' command is used for sub-commands of an operator, the general
# form is
#
#      op name, sub-command [,arguments ....]
#
# help OperatorType will display list of sub-commands for a specific
# Operator type.  The MIDIPlayer operator has the following three
# sub-commands (among other).
#
#     op player, stop
#     op player, play
#     op player, load, filename
#
# Macros may be used to simplify commonly used commands
#

macro stop, player, stop
macro play, player, play
macro load, player, load, $0

# Hereafter 'stop', 'play' and 'load' may be used instead of the more
# cumbersome op with sub-command form.   The $0 term in the load macro
# substitutes the first argument to the macro into the expanded form
#
#     load /foo/bar/baz
#
# Expands to
#
#    op player, load, /foo/bar/baz
#


# Some Useful commands.
#
# q-operators   - returns list of all operators
# q-roots       - returns list of all root operators
# print-graph   - prints structure of the MIDI process graph.
# info name     - displays current state of Operator name.


# The following commands relate to MIDI channel selections.
#
# q-channel-mode operator-name
#    Returns either NoChannel, SingleChannel or MultiChannel.
#
# q-channels operator-name
#    Returns list of selected channels.
#
# q-channel-selected operator-name, channel
#    Returns true if channel is enabled, false otherwise.
#
# select-channels operator-name, chan-A, chan-B, ....
#    Selects all listed channels as enabled.
#    For Operators with SingleChannel mode, the final channel is selected.
#
# deselect-channels operator-name. chan-A, chan-B, ...
#    Disables all selected channels.
#    Ignored by Operators with SingleChannelMode.
#
# select-all-channels operator-name
#    Ignored by Operators with SingleChannelMode (see BUG 008).
#
# deselect-all-channels operator-name
#    Ignored by Operators with SingleChannelMode.
#
# invert-channels operator-name
#    Ignored by Operators with SingleChannelMode.
