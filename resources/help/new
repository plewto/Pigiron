Command     new op-type, name
OSC         /pig/new op-type, name

Creates new operator of given type and name.
Use the q-operator-type command for a list of available types.

A slightly different syntax is used for creating MIDIInput and
MIDIOutput operators:

            new MIDIInput, name, device
	    new MIDIOutput, name, device

Use the q-midi-inputs and q-midi-output commands for a list of MIDI
devices.  The device may be specified either by its integer position in the
list or by a unique sub-string of it's name.


Operator names must be unique.  It is an error if an operator with the
same name already exists.


OSC Returns: ACK The actual operator name.
             ERROR if op-type invalid or device invalid
