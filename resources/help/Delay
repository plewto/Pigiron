Delay Operator

The Delay Operator adds a note on/off delay with key-mappings, velocity
shift and presets.

There are 6-preset programs accessible either by MIDI program change or
OSC commands.   Each program consist of the following parameters:

    1) Count - number of note repeats, may be between 1 and 6 inclusive

    2) keytable - table of key-number conversions.  The keytable is applied
       on each note repetition.  For example assume the table contents
       produce a simple transposition by fifths,  table(n) --> n+7.
       If the note C4 is processed with count = 4 the generated note
       sequence will be:  C4, G4, D5, A5

    3) delayPattern - is a list of delay times in milliseconds: d1, d2, d3, ....
       The first repeat is d1 ms after the initial note, the next is delayed
       by d2 ms.  If the number of delay-times is less then the repeat
       count, the values cycle back to the beginning.
       
   4) velocityShift - amount to add/subtract to velocity on each repetition.
      For a initial velocity v, and a velocity shift -4, the resulting
      velocities are v, v-4, v-8, v-12 ...

General parameters:

    1) MIDI channel of note to process.  Events on all other channels are
       not effected.
    
    2) forwardPrograms, if false do not re-transmit program changes on the
       selected MIDI channel.



Commands  TODO: add command details

The delay-pattern, repeat-count, velocity-shift and table value commands
are applied to the current program.
