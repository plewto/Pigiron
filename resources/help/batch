Command     batch filename
OSC         /pig/batch filename

Loads filename as an OSC batch file.
Within the file commands are listed in sequence.
Lines beginning with # are ignored.

The filename prefix may indicate one of two special directories:

~/filename is relative to the user's home directory.
!/filename is relative to the configuration directory.


If a file is placed in the batch directory, it may be loaded simply by
entering it's name at the prompt.   The default location for batch files is

    ~/.config/pigiron/batch/


Care should be used in naming files in the batch directory so they do not
shadow existing command names.
