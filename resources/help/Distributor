Operator Distributor

A Distributor is an Operator which re-channelizes incoming MIDI messages.

Multiple output channels may be selected simultaneously.  The message
(regardless of it's original channel) is re-broadcast on each of the
selected output channels.  Non-channel messages are always passed
unaltered.
