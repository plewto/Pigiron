Command     macro name, command, template...
OSC         /pig/macro name, command, template...

Defines new macro.

A macro replaces name with command and template.  For example

    /pig/macro p, ping

Creates a new macro named 'p' with expands to 'ping'.  Entering p at the
prompt executes ping.

    /pig/p   --> ping

The optional template values specifies arguments to the expanded command.
Template values may be:

    1) Literal strings
    2) Have special form '$n' where n is an integer index.  Upon macro
       execution '$n' is replaced with the nth argument.   The following
       defines a replacement for 'new MIDIInput' 


       /pig/macro input,  new, MIDIInput, $0, $1

       Calling /pig/input dog, Arturia
       Expands to: new MIDIInput, dog, Arturia


A practical example to simplify interaction with MIDIPlayer.

    /pig: new MIDIPlayer, player
    /pig: macro play, op, player, play
    /pig: macro stop, op, player, stop
    /pig: macro load, op, player, load, $0

Hereafter to load a MIDI file simply enter 'load filename' instead of the
more cumbersome 'op player, load, filename'


Macros may not refer to previous macros. The following example will not
work.

    /pig: macro foo, ping
    /pig: macro baz, foo

The baz macro will fail.

Macros are only applicable to the REPL command line or inside a batch
file.   They do not define new OSC commands.
